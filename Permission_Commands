### Understanding Permissions

Linux permissions are represented by three digits, where:
- `4` stands for Read
- `2` stands for Write
- `1` stands for Execute

For example:
- `7` (4+2+1) gives Read, Write, and Execute permissions.
- `6` (4+2) gives Read and Write permissions.
- `5` (4+1) gives Read and Execute permissions.
- `4` gives Read permission only.
